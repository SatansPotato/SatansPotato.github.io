  <h1>Art Site of Erik Sihvonen</h1>
  <p> 
  This website is meant to be an testing version of a future website where I will post my art. This website may move to another hosting site at one point or another and may change the URL in the future.

  Updates: This website is being constructed in folder so the website will update all at once.
